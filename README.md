# Text Mining

This is the homepage for the Olin Spring 2018 Software Design Text Mining project as done by Lydia Hodges.

## Project Overview

I used Project Gutenberg to mine text for the first segment of the project and a combination of online PDFs and pitt.edu for the second segment. Cosine similarity via Python was used on the texts to determine similarity between the different writings.
